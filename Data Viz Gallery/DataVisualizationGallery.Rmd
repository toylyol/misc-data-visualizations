## `r fa( "info-circle", fill = "#3E6E82" )`

- This visualization is a hexbin map of the United States; it features data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' Multiple Chronic Conditions (MCC) [dataset](https://data.cms.gov/medicare-chronic-conditions/multiple-chronic-conditions). 

- The MCC data were retrieved through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services [API](https://data.cms.gov/api-docs). More information about the dataset can be viewed in the [data dictionary](https://data.cms.gov/resources/multiple-chronic-conditions-data-dictionary) and [methodology documentation](https://data.cms.gov/resources/medicare-chronic-conditions-methodology).

- The hexagonal shapefile of the United States was obtained from [Carto](https://team.carto.com/u/andrew/tables/andrew.us_states_hexgrid/public/map). It can be downloaded in other formats, such as GeoJSON.

- Holtz Yan's excellent [hex bin map tutorial](https://r-graph-gallery.com/328-hexbin-map-of-the-usa.html) on The R Graph Gallery provided the data source for the hexagonal shapefileâ€”as well as helpful hints for manipulating the file.

- Thanks to Bruno Kenzo for [inspiration](https://github.com/KenzoBH/Visualizations) on how to display this collection of data visualizations.

- Finishing touches were created with the aid of Holtz Yan's [Pimp my RMD: a few tips for R Markdown](https://holtzy.github.io/Pimp-my-rmd/).

- The color palette was created using Cara Thompson's [monochromeR package](https://github.com/cararthompson/monochromeR).

- The alt text was generated using the formula provided by Liz Hare in her October 2022 [presentation](https://lizharedogs.github.io/RLadiesNYAltText "Click here to be directed to Liz's presentation slides.") for R-Ladies NYC.
